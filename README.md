# Filterable Product List

This repository contains a dynamic, filterable product list application built in two phases:

### **Phase 1**: Static Website (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)

-   The first phase of the project is built using pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
-   It includes a dynamic product listing, where users can filter products by category.
-   Categories and products are dynamically generated, and the filtering is handled efficiently.
-   The design is fully responsive, making sure that the product list and filter buttons adapt to mobile and desktop screens.
-   **Security Focus**: The project avoids the use of `innerHTML` to prevent XSS vulnerabilities by using safe DOM manipulation techniques.
